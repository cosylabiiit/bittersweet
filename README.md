# BitterSweet: Building machine learning models for predicting the bitter and sweet taste of small molecules

## Abstract
The dichotomy of sweet and bitter tastes is a salient evolutionary feature of human
gustatory system with an innate attraction to sweet taste and aversion to bitterness. A better
understanding of molecular correlates of bitter-sweet taste gradient is crucial for identification of
natural as well as synthetic compounds of desirable taste on this axis. While previous studies have
advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of bitter-sweet taste and contributed models for
their identification, there is ample scope to enhance these models by meticulous compilation of bitter-
sweet molecules and utilization of a wide spectrum of molecular descriptors. Towards these goals,
based on structured data compilation our study provides an integrative framework with state-of-the-art
machine learning models for bitter-sweet taste prediction (BitterSweet). We compare different sets of
molecular descriptors for their predictive performance and further identify important features as well
as feature blocks. The utility of BitterSweet models is demonstrated by taste prediction on large
specialized chemical sets such as FlavorDB, FooDB, SuperSweet, Super Natural II, DSSTox, and
DrugBank. To facilitate future research in this direction, we make all datasets and BitterSweet models
publicly available, and also present an end-to-end software for bitter-sweet taste prediction based on
freely available chemical descriptors.
